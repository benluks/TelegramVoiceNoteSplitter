[00:00]  Hey, good morning.
[00:05]  I am very tired today.
[00:10]  I woke up and I...
[00:15]  I don't know, I got up around 10.
[00:18]  But I could feel on my body that I would go there already, which...
[00:23]  You know, I was okay.
[00:24]  I just like, I could really go back to sleep.
[00:30]  So I didn't.
[00:33]  I just got up and started my day.
[00:36]  I don't know, I did a few things, but it's just like, it's all been kind of guided by the fact that I'm pretty tired.
[00:44]  You know, that's okay.
[00:47]  Last day of work, I think I've done enough.
[00:55]  So a few things I should still check out.
[00:58]  I was just looking at a new laptop because I suddenly had like, fuck it.
[01:04]  You know, I'm so happy with this new laptop that...
[01:09]  The only thing that I don't like about it is the fact that, like, oh, if I want to install flutter,
[01:14]  it's telling me that I need a better chip and immediately I'm like, okay, I'll buy the better one.
[01:19]  I don't care anymore.
[01:21]  And then I'll send this one back, or maybe just like sell it to my seller, who cares at this point.
[01:33]  I don't know if that's easy.
[01:35]  I don't know, so I should figure that out.
[01:37]  But I'm like, you know, like, I just take the money for my savings and I'm like, this is...
[01:46]  You know, like a laptop is necessary, especially with, I don't know, I guess what I'm realizing with end-transliables
[01:53]  that I'm always a little bit behind because my tech is always a little bit behind.
[01:57]  And so maybe I should just finally get something that's...
[02:00]  I found one now that's like, it's from late 2023.
[02:05]  It has an M2 Pro chip.
[02:08]  There is a better one. There's an M3 one, but...
[02:16]  I looked at the comparison between that one and the M2 Pro chip.
[02:24]  And it seems like, honestly, I don't know, it might be faster in some ways, but in other ways it's very similarly.
[02:33]  So, I like, you know, I don't need to go like the newest, newest, newest, but if I can go, just like, whatever is the best that it has to offer.
[02:44]  That's good enough for me.
[02:47]  I think I'm going to put just like a more recent model that it'll go with more...
[02:53]  I'll probably be able to go like two OSs up from what I have now.
[02:59]  I don't even know what I'm going to do.
[03:02]  I don't know why I'm talking about this.
[03:09]  There is like a few random things that I've been wanting to tell you, and so I'm just going to tell you them because otherwise I'll forget.
[03:21]  One.
[03:24]  I just bought the best thing at Aldi, which is...
[03:28]  I'll send you a picture of it, but it's like...
[03:31]  It's a thing that you can put on those giant water bottles that you get here.
[03:39]  And it's like a pump or a dispenser, so you just put it on top, and then you push the button and water comes out.
[03:47]  And because that's the thing, it's like with those big bottles, it's so annoying if you ever want to use the water because then you can't...
[03:54]  You feel like, you know, it's heavy and stuff.
[03:58]  And I was thinking actually about having some water upstairs, so there's not sure what upstairs, if I want to drink something, but also...
[04:06]  You know, there's like... just in general, because the water's so hard to get out, I...
[04:12]  I was like, this seems like a great idea, and it works great, and you can screw it on to basically anything.
[04:19]  Part of it is like, I could make something out of ceramics, although that would, like, do even purpose.
[04:25]  But the idea that you could just put this on many of things and just like dispense whatever the...
[04:32]  They do say that it works with... they're like, you should only do it with water, which...
[04:39]  I don't know. I feel like we could try it with wine, I don't know, I don't see why not.
[04:47]  So that's exciting.
[04:51]  Second thing.
[04:53]  This happened yesterday, but yesterday I went to all these, it gets some food for lunch, and before me...
[05:03]  Okay. You know how when you like walk up to the cue for... to pay for stuff?
[05:14]  Isn't there so what else comes, and... you know, that either like, oh no, you go first or...
[05:20]  Or they go first, and so yesterday this lady... scoops before me.
[05:28]  To be fair... she might have been there a long time, like I don't, but like...
[05:32]  As I walked up, she... went before me, and I was like, okay, that's fine.
[05:39]  Like if she was here before, that's okay. She was there with her son.
[05:44]  And so this woman, she's like... I want to say like, in her 60s.
[05:51]  Maybe like Indian... you know, I could not tell you exactly where they were from,
[05:59]  but she had her son with her who was like...
[06:04]  Very tall, very like strong, and in there...
[06:11]  Okay, so basically when she went before me, you know, normally people do that when they had, like, that's fine.
[06:18]  This lady bought the entire store, so she had two...
[06:27]  and carts full of bananas, and another cart that was like, like, like, drinks, like, pat...
[06:39]  You know, but like, big... those like carton, and then like little, like, packets of drinks,
[06:45]  and then just like four of those, and they were big and heavy.
[06:50]  What else did they have? Is that toilet paper?
[06:57]  I feel like there was one other thing.
[07:00]  But basically, so she went before me. I had like three items, right?
[07:07]  I just... I just like put two shopping carts full of bananas.
[07:15]  The thing I didn't put in, I was like, you could have...
[07:20]  Let me go for it. You know, I mean, it's like you don't have to truly, it's like that, like, whatever.
[07:25]  But you could have a lot of people first.
[07:28]  Because I was just so hungry, and then this lady was putting, like, all of the bananas on there,
[07:34]  and then obviously having her son, like...
[07:38]  Obviously what she said at home is like, I need someone to help me carry all of these groceries that I'm about to buy.
[07:44]  And I like, genuinely, I can't imagine the bananas being so cheap, but all the way that you would have to bulk by them.
[07:51]  Like, what is she making? I just... I want to know.
[07:55]  And then when they were done, I still couldn't go because there was just so much stuff.
[08:01]  So like, in the middle of it, they just had to, like, stop putting bananas on the thing,
[08:07]  put them back on the other side, and then continue. So, like, it took so long.
[08:12]  But the whole thing was very funny, and the whole thing told me so much about the relation between the son and the...
[08:20]  And it had to be your son because, like, it wasn't like a nephew. You know what I mean?
[08:27]  Or maybe it was, but maybe it just... But his demeanor was like, I'm here with my mom.
[08:33]  And then at the end of it, he was checking the receipt, which I thought was so funny too.
[08:41]  It's like, other checking words. You know, your charge does for...
[08:48]  Do charges for 70 bananas. Really took 69 in terms of the...
[08:54]  So, that was funny. And then today, I was walking, and I saw...
[09:01]  This is the third thing I want to tell you.
[09:05]  I was walking, and I saw one of those garbage things, you know, the public, like, you could put garbage in them.
[09:16]  And there was a repairman, and he clearly was like, oh, broken, and so you'd repair it.
[09:21]  And as I walked, as I walked past, he pulled out the thing that had broken the machine, and what he pulled out was the bone.
[09:36]  It was like, one of those, like, ham legs, but it had been, like, pretty much, like, used out.
[09:42]  So there's just, like, the rest of that, and that's what you pulled out.
[09:47]  And I love that so much. Like, I've never seen a thing so Spanish. I love it.
[09:53]  Like, immediately, it was such a story. Like, only in Spain, would you be like, yeah, pulling an animal bone.
[10:03]  Like, garbage disposal.
[10:09]  I just, now I'm trying to think of, like, every country in the equivalent.
[10:15]  Like, what would be the big item that is stuck in the garbage, in the public garbage disposal bins?
[10:29]  Yeah, so those were three random stories that I wanted to tell you.
[10:36]  And philosophy. I mean, yeah, it sounds like you're in a good time with it, but I'm also, you know, like, I guess you didn't talk that much about philosophy.
[10:44]  But it totally is. It's like, what you were saying, like, it is what you make of it.
[10:54]  That's a very, very, very small right answer. And in some ways, there's no wrong answer either.
[11:07]  It's funny because I mean, I obviously told you, I really want to watch the first moment.
[11:14]  I really liked it. It's very art-see.
[11:18]  It's a lot like I really, what I expected from it, like, seeing the trailer. I was like, oh, classic, none shenanigans.
[11:33]  I'm trying not to, like, because I want to say things, but I also don't want to spoil it, obviously.
[11:40]  But yeah, it's very pleasantly surprised. It was like, a lot. It was more artsy than it was scary, I'll say.
[11:48]  But that was very okay with me.
[11:53]  And it's funny because I realized only after the movie was over.
[11:59]  And they made like a weird reference at the end.
[12:03]  And I was like, I don't know what that's about. And then it turns out that it's actually part of the, the open
[12:13]  Cinematic Universe. So I think it's like a prequel maybe, which, honestly, I think it's such a, like, the way that I watch it, it's a very standalone movie.
[12:26]  It really doesn't need to, you know, like, it's a part of something. I get that.
[12:33]  But it also doesn't matter, which I think is the best way to do that, where it's like, if it's, you know, some people might see it because they've seen the other movies.
[12:42]  And I want to see how that ends up. But like, having not seen this movie before, I felt like,
[12:52]  if you watch it with the lens of this is about womanhood and this is about the patriarchy, it's such a movie.
[13:04]  It's just a really good movie. Like, there's so many little things that are so beautifully put and I think, you know what, without spoiling it, I want to say that for me the movie was really about a woman.
[13:21]  Being treated in a certain way and kind of being okay with that being like, being like, yeah, it's just how it is.
[13:37]  But then watching other people treat other women, the way that she was treated and then realizing that actually it's not okay.
[13:50]  And I feel like the whole movie is just like a lot of women going through different types of experiences and seeing other women go through experiences and kind of, you know, it's like the moment of,
[14:05]  and especially because of the theme none, like I don't think it was poiling too much. You know, it's in general, there's such a theme there of like you were submitting or you're submitting.
[14:20]  Yeah, like you were submitting yourself to the church, the patriarchy, the power is that be and you're saying like, okay, I give myself to you.
[14:36]  And I think that it would have itself is such an interesting thing because there's always like, you know, it's like the they do it because they want to.
[14:46]  But then as you watch it, you're also like, okay, but do they know what they're signing up for and do you know, and it's like, how much do you really and how much are you like defending a system that maybe isn't great for you in the first place and I think that that's maybe what makes none so interesting is that it's just like a woman who has devoted her life to.
[15:15]  God and therefore a man and therefore, you know, it's like.
[15:22]  But also not because you're not directly subjecting yourself to God.
[15:32]  As in, like it's not the same as like being married to a man where you also have to subject yourself to a man. So that part, like.
[15:41]  I just thought it worked so so well and it really for me kind of embodied the experience of being a woman and like when I was a kid, I was very.
[15:56]  A lot outspoken about it, but I think I was kind of an anti-feminist because I was I really lived under the illusion that's like, oh yeah, if I just.
[16:07]  You know, mental respect me if they just like, you know, if they just get to know me, then they'll they'll love me and respect me and.
[16:20]  And listen to me and then as you grow up, you're kind of seeing, you know, it's kind of like like a horror movie where it's like you see something you're like, oh, that's kind of weird.
[16:32]  And then you see another thing and you're like, that's even weirder and then another thing happens, you're like, but that's definitely not okay.
[16:41]  And slowly it's like by piecing all of these experiences together of women, you realize that it's not just like a weird thing that happened, but it's the system and it's designed to do that to you and it's designed to.
[16:58]  And not take you seriously and you watch women go through things that you will be going through yourself and you're watching it and you're like, well, that seems rough, you know, and it's like you don't know yet that you yourself will be a victim of it in some way too.
[17:14]  And at the same time, like if you've been through it already, you watch other women go through the same motions and like go through the same traumas and.
[17:29]  Yeah, I think that's the movie did really well. That's what I really liked about it.
[17:35]  And yeah, I definitely want to watch it with you.
[17:43]  I just, yeah, I be curious to the, it's like, I mean, obviously so many horror movies have like really good themes and things to say, but this one, like, I feel like they also.
[17:57]  So I don't know, part of it's like maybe they just made it as a.
[18:01]  Um.
[18:05]  As a prequel to an existing.
[18:09]  series.
[18:11]  Um.
[18:12]  But this one does seem particularly focused on women and I really like that. It's like, and I know I want to watch the other ones because I think they're less about women.
[18:21]  But I still enjoy the idea of watching that with the backdrop of this prequel and kind of knowing that this is what happened before.
[18:30]  So yeah, very excited about that.
[18:34]  All right, this is super long and I'm sorry.
[18:39]  Um.
[18:40]  I'm going to stop now.
