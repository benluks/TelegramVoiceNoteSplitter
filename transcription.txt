[00:00]  Every day, I think the same bird, but maybe it's not the same bird, comes to visit me and
[00:10]  he sits on the railing and he looks inside.
[00:15]  Sometimes the wind goes open, but it just doesn't come in.
[00:19]  And it's just so cute.
[00:22]  And I love it.
[00:23]  I feel like sleeping beauty.
[00:26]  Bird, it's no white or one of it's sleeping beauty, obviously.
[00:30]  It's like, first of all, it's the obvious choice for me and it's also was my favorite
[00:35]  very growing up, which.
[00:40]  The irony is I think becoming just more and more apparent as I grow up.
[00:48]  But anyway, man, I'm glad that comedy went alright.
[00:54]  Like it just did what it had to do.
[00:59]  Because if anything, that's maybe what we talked about yesterday of deciding whether or not
[01:03]  we want to continue with it or not.
[01:07]  This is a better position to decide that from because if you bomb and you just do badly,
[01:12]  then it feels like a defeat.
[01:17]  It feels like the reason I wanted to quit ceramics is because it got overwhelming for a second.
[01:28]  But now I love it again.
[01:30]  I'm just looking forward to it so much and it's just such a, it really is back to being
[01:36]  the thing that I wanted it to be, which is this external creative outlet in a way to
[01:46]  create things and have some, yeah, it's like a combination between exercise and a certain
[01:57]  amount of creative energy.
[01:59]  But then also I think a lot of it is just very practical, very like how do you build
[02:04]  something and I think that combination is very good for me.
[02:10]  I'm sorry I'm talking about ceramics now.
[02:13]  Yeah, but it's like I'm glad comedy was comedy and, and then you had a good time.
[02:25]  I want to know which jokes you, you ended up doing and like how the crowd reacted to them
[02:31]  and whether, whether they reacted as you wanted them to or because I, even with good crowds,
[02:38]  I find that there are sometimes one joke that normally does really well, but then in that
[02:43]  audience gets like zero lives.
[02:46]  Like, I don't know, it's always hard to tell.
[02:54]  I, man, last night I just couldn't sleep because I was so like I realized that the more
[03:02]  I do creative stuff, the more I just get really manic.
[03:11]  And that happened yesterday and I was just like writing things for the tit's book just
[03:21]  because again it's like it's the most low key thing that I can think of right now and
[03:25]  it's still funny and again it's like I find entertainment in it.
[03:36]  And I'm really thinking about how I could make it educational.
[03:39]  Like you learned something about birds, but you also learn about tits.
[03:48]  It's like this, this like I just wanted to work both ways.
[03:54]  You know, I wanted to work for the adults and I wanted to, I want kids to just be like, yeah,
[04:00]  tits are fucking great, you know.
[04:02]  And then like teach them a little facts about tits and
[04:10]  I keep going back and forth between a title.
[04:13]  First of is like tits in the wild, but then I wanted it to be
[04:17]  adventures of a great tit.
[04:21]  Because then I can make like a story around a tit, but then it's maybe as harder to make an
[04:25]  educational.
[04:26]  So I don't know.
[04:31]  And then I also thought about doing a shark book.
[04:38]  Something called like I kind of wanted to be like those pyjama sandbooks where
[04:43]  it's a kid who is scared of, you know, like the one I told you about like darkness.
[04:50]  And then he goes into his closet to defeat darkness.
[04:54]  And then when he finally gets to darkness, he, you know, he meets darkness.
[04:58]  And then he's like, I'm here to defeat you.
[05:01]  And then he's like, oh my god, is that fun?
[05:04]  And then he's like, no, I'm going to put you in this lunch box.
[05:07]  And he's like, oh, but I never get to do anything fun.
[05:11]  And then he's like, what would you want to do?
[05:13]  It's like, oh, I just, I love to play.
[05:15]  And then he's like, wow, I didn't know you love to play.
[05:18]  He's like, yeah, but when I get when I'm out, it's dark.
[05:22]  So nobody's there to play.
[05:24]  And then he's like, oh, there must be so lonely.
[05:25]  And then they play a game together.
[05:29]  And I want that story, but for sharks.
[05:33]  And then also have it be about like, you know, maybe climate change or the way that humans actually
[05:43]  are much scarier to sharks than sharks are to humans.
[05:48]  And then I like part of music I want to start off the book with a little kid, maybe a little girl.
[05:53]  I don't know, who is afraid of sharks because of the poster from from
[06:03]  because truly I think that is what like started it.
[06:06]  And I think it would be really cute to do like a little reference to that.
[06:11]  And again, it's like for the 50 year existence of of jaws, maybe that will be my, my way of like
[06:20]  processing that trauma.
[06:24]  And instead of writing a huge essay, although I could like have the huge essay up to to be like,
[06:29]  if you want to explore my thoughts on sharks,
[06:32]  this is what you had GPT made out of all the things that I've ever said about sharks.
[06:42]  Yeah, so that's kind of the energy I have.
[06:45]  And now I have to go back to work, but I also should go to supermarket to get some lunch.
[06:53]  So, you know, I'm kind of going back and for I might do like a little bit of work and then take a break
[06:58]  get and my hair is so a little bit wet as you can see in the picture.
[07:05]  I just blew dry it for like 15 minutes and it's so lovely dry, which I don't know if that's long,
[07:12]  but it was long enough for me and I was like I'm done now.
[07:16]  It looks good.
[07:18]  Like it's it's mostly dry and I'll just let it like, like, air dry for the rest of it.
[07:24]  And then I get to, because now I still have that wet look and it's kind of crunchy, but if it's
[07:31]  fully dry, then I can kind of like scrunch it out and rough it up so it doesn't look so wet anymore.
[07:40]  I don't know if you notice that too, but yeah, I just thought the before and after it was fun,
[07:47]  because I really do feel like towards the end of my washing
[07:51]  and streaks, so to say, my hair just kind of goes back to what it used to be before,
[07:57]  like I feel like it's still more wavy than it was before, but
[08:11]  but it's honestly like when I met my family, nobody said anything about my hair to the point where I'm
[08:18]  like, dude, I got a par of like someone should notice, right?
[08:23]  But it's kind of funny because it just maybe feels like people are like, I just just her hair now,
[08:30]  which is good, good. Like it's the best case in it. Jesus, best case scenario.
[08:40]  Oh my god.
[08:41]  Hey, go.
[08:48]  Okay, best case scenario because I don't have to deal with stupid comments that people are making.
[08:59]  But it's also kind of funny, of just how much I agonized over it and how much I was like,
[09:03]  oh my god, and then after you know, people are going to ask, I also really thought people in
[09:08]  comedy were going to ask about it and then they don't have to be funny about it.
[09:12]  And I realized that nobody gives a shit ever. And especially not when it's a change that,
[09:20]  you know, it's like if you see that first picture of me, it's like, yeah, that looks,
[09:23]  but it doesn't look like someone who's had anything done to their hair, if you compare it to my hair before.
[09:30]  But then I wash it and it's different again, it's like, okay, well,
[09:34]  this is a fun journey.
[09:38]  And yeah, keeps you, keeps you off the streets.
[09:42]  All right, this is more than enough talk. Goodbye.
